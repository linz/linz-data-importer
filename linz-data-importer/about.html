<h1><strong>LDS Plugin</strong> - beta</h1>
<p>The LDS Plugin couples QGIS and the <a href="https://data.linz.govt.nz/data/">LINZ 
Data Services (LDS)</a>&nbsp; (and others - see changing scope) to provide simple 
importing of LINZ data.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Changing Scope</h2>
<p>The initial scope of this plugin was to just couple the LDS and QGIS. However 
as other New Zealand agencies also make use of the same technology the settings 
interface also allows these other agencies open data web portals to be configured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At time of release this plugin supports the coupling of the below open data portals with QGIS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://data.linz.govt.nz/">data.linz.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;(Toitū Te Whenua - Land Information New Zealand)</li>
<li><a href="https://data.mfe.govt.nz/">data.mfe.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;(Manatū Mō Te Taiao - Ministry for the Environment)</li>
<li><a href="https://datafinder.stats.govt.nz/">datafinder.stats.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;(Tatauranga Aotearoa - Statistics New Zealand)</li>
<li><a href="https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/">lris.scinfo.org.nz</a>&nbsp;(Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research)</li>
<li><a href="https://geodata.nzdf.mil.nz/">https://geodata.nzdf.mil.nz</a>&nbsp;(Te Ope Kātua o Aotearoa - New Zealand Defence Force</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Selecting a Service&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>The LDS Plugin supports data served over WFS, WMS and WMTS protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/linz-data-service/guides-
and-documentation/which-web-service-should-i-use">online resource</a>&nbsp; available 
on the LINZ website for more on these protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>API Keys&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Prior to using the plugin a domain and related API Key must be stored via the 
"Settings" menu. When saving your API key this will trigger the plugin to request 
all of the services dataset information. This may take sometime. For more on API 
keys please see the LDS user resources.</p>
LDS&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/linz-data-service/
guides-and-documentation/creating-an-api-key">resources</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Coordinate Reference System</strong></h2>
<p>The available CRS options for each layer are shown next to the import button 
(This is in terms of its ESPG code). If the datasource is stored in multiple CRSs 
the user can select which CRS to be requested from the server.</p>
<p>* Note if the QGIS projects CRS and the imported datasets CRS do not match, 
QGIS will reporject the imported data to the projects CRS. Beware: reprojecting 
data can degrade spatial accuracies and relationships.</p>
<p>When importing the first dataset via the plugin for the QGIS session the plugin 
will change the QGIS projects CRS to match the imported data. If On The Fly (OTF) 
projection is not enable The plugin will also turn this on to allow any further 
datasets to be reprojected. Both these project settings changes will be notified 
to the user when they occur.</p>
<h2><strong>Requests, Responses, Patience and Caching</strong></h2>
<p>When saving a Domain and API key for the first time via the Setting menu the 
plugin will request the capabilities documents for each service type (WMS, WMTS, WFS). 
When these documents are large this can cause the plugin to appear inactive. 
The good news is this is the only interaction with the plug where substantial patience
may be required. Once the initial documents are fetched, they will be cached and 
will be updated in the background each time the plugin is started.</p>
<h2><strong>Filtering</strong></h2>
<p>The left hand panel allows users to filter by service types (either, All, WFS, WMS, WMTS).</p>
<p>All column headers can be toggled to allow ascending or descending ordering of their data.</p>
<p>Text can be entered in the "Filter Data Sets" search bar to filter the datasets by keyword.&nbsp;</p>
