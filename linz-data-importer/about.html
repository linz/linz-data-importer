<h1><strong>LDS Plugin</strong> - beta</h1>
<p>The LDS Plugin couples QGIS and the <a href="https://data.linz.govt.nz/data/">LINZ 
Data Services (LDS)</a>&nbsp; (and others - see changing scope) to provide simple 
importing of LINZ data.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Changing Scope</h2>
<p>The initial scope of this plugin was to couple the LDS and QGIS. However 
as other New Zealand agencies also make use of the same technology their data 
can also be imported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At time of release this plugin supports the coupling of the below open data portals with QGIS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://data.linz.govt.nz/">data.linz.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;(Toitū Te Whenua - Land Information New Zealand)</li>
<li><a href="https://data.mfe.govt.nz/">data.mfe.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;(Manatū Mō Te Taiao - Ministry for the Environment)</li>
<li><a href="https://datafinder.stats.govt.nz/">datafinder.stats.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;(Tatauranga Aotearoa - Statistics New Zealand)</li>
<li><a href="https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/">lris.scinfo.org.nz</a>&nbsp;(Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research)</li>
<li><a href="https://geodata.nzdf.mil.nz/">https://geodata.nzdf.mil.nz</a>&nbsp;(Te Ope Kātua o Aotearoa - New Zealand Defence Force</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Selecting a Service / Protocol&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>The LDS Plugin supports data served over WFS, WMS and WMTS protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/linz-data-service/guides-
and-documentation/which-web-service-should-i-use">online resource</a>&nbsp; available 
on the LINZ website for more on these protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>API Keys&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Prior to using the plugin, a domain and related API Key must be stored via the 
"Settings" menu. When saving your API key this will trigger the plugin to request 
all of the domain's dataset information. This may take sometime. For more on API 
keys please see the LDS user resources.</p>
LDS&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/linz-data-service/
guides-and-documentation/creating-an-api-key">resources</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Coordinate Reference System</strong></h2>
<p>The available CRS options for each layer are shown next to the import button (This is in 
terms of EPSG code). If the data source is stored in multiple CRSs the user 
can select which CRS the dataset is to be requested in from the server. </p>
<p>* Note; if the QGIS projects CRS and the imported datasets CRS do not match, 
QGIS will reproject the imported data to the projects CRS. Beware: reprojecting 
data can degrade spatial accuracies and relationships.</p>
<p>When importing the first dataset via the plugin for a QGIS session, the plugin 
will change the QGIS projects CRS to match the imported data. If On The Fly (OTF)
projection is not enable, the plugin will enable OTF to allow any 
further datasets to be reprojected to the project's / QGIS session's CRS. 
When these changes occur the user will be informed via the QGIS message bar.</p>
<h2><strong>Requests, Responses, Patience and Caching</strong></h2>
<p>When saving a Domain and API key for the first time via the Setting menu, the plugin 
will request the capabilities documents for each service / protocol type (WMS, WMTS, WFS). 
The data portal's server can be slow to respond with these documents causing the 
plugin to appear inactive. The good news is this is the only interaction with the 
plugin where substantial patience may be required. Once the initial documents
are fetched, they will be cached and updated in the background each time 
the plugin is started.</p>
<h2><strong>Filtering</strong></h2>
<p>The left hand panel allows users to filter by service types (either, All, WFS, WMS, WMTS).</p>
<p>All column headers can be toggled to allow ascending or descending ordering of their data.</p>
<p>Text can be entered in the "Filter Data Sets" search bar to filter the datasets by keyword.&nbsp;</p>
