<h2>LDS Data Importer</h2>
<p>The intent of this QGIS Plugin is to allow the easy importing of 
<a href="data.govt.linz.nz">LINZ Data Service</a> data (as well as other data services 
- see Changing Scope) into QGIS.</p>

<h2>Changing Scope</h2>
<p>The initial scope of this plugin was to couple the LDS and QGIS. However as 
other New Zealand agencies also make use of the same technology their data can 
also be imported.

<p>At the time of release this plugin supports the coupling of the below open 
data portals with QGIS:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<a href="data.linz.govt.nz">data.linz.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;(Toitū Te Whenua - Land Information New Zealand)</li>
<li>&nbsp;<a href="data.mfe.govt.nz">data.mfe.govt.nz</a>&nbsp; (Manatū Mō Te Taiao - Ministry for the Environment)</li>
<li>&nbsp;<a href="datafinder.stats.govt.nz">datafinder.stats.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;(Tatauranga Aotearoa - Statistics New Zealand)</li>
<li>&nbsp;<a href="lris.scinfo.org.nz">lris.scinfo.org.nz</a>&nbsp; (Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research)</li>
<li>&nbsp;<a href="geodata.nzdf.mil.nz">geodata.nzdf.mil.nz</a>&nbsp;(Te Ope Kātua o Aotearoa - New Zealand Defence Force)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Selecting a Service / Protocol</h2>
<p>The LDS Plugin supports data served over WFS, WMS and WMTS protocols. 
Please see the resource available on the 
<a href="(http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/linz-data-service/guides-and-documentation/which-web-service-should-i-use">LINZ website</a>
for more on these protocols.</p>

<h2>API Keys</h2>
<p>Prior to using the plugin, a domain and related API Key must be stored via the 
"Settings" menu.&nbsp;When saving your API key this will trigger the plugin to 
request all of the domain's dataset information. This may take some time.&nbsp;For 
more on API keys please see 
the <a href="(http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/linz-data-service/guides-and-documentation/creating-an-api-key">LDS user resources</a>.</p>

<h2>Coordinate Reference System (CRS)</h2>
<p>The available CRS options for each layer are shown next to the import button (in&nbsp;terms of EPSG code). 
If the data source is stored in multiple CRSs the user&nbsp;can select which CRS the dataset 
is to be requested in from the server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Note; if the QGIS project's CRS and the imported dataset's CRS do not&nbsp;match, 
QGIS will reproject the imported data to the project's CRS.&nbsp;<strong>Beware</strong>: 
reprojecting data can degrade spatial accuracies and relationships.</p>
<p>When importing the first dataset via the plugin for a QGIS session, the plugin 
will change the QGIS project's CRS to match the imported data. When these changes 
occur the user will be informed via the QGIS message bar.</p>

<h2>Requests, Responses, Patience and Caching</h2>
<p>When saving a Domain and API key for the first time via the Setting menu, 
the plugin will request the capabilities documents for each service / protocol 
type (WMS, WMTS, WFS).&nbsp;&nbsp;The data portal's server can be slow to respond 
with these documents causing the plugin to appear inactive. The good news is this 
is the only interaction with the plugin where substantial patience may be required. 
Once the initial documents&nbsp;are fetched, they will be cached and updated in 
the background each time the plugin is started.</p>

<h2>Filtering</h2>
<p>The left hand panel allows users to filter by service / protocol types (either, 
All, WFS, WMS, WMTS).&nbsp;All column headers can be toggled to allow ascending or 
descending ordering of their data.&nbsp;Text can be entered in the "Filter Data Sets" 
search bar to filter the datasets by keyword.</p>
